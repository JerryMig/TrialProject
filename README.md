# TrialProject

This project was initially an interview app. 
I've make a couple of changes based on what I've leaned over time. 
The overall feature is fetching data from a staging RESTful API.

1. Click on upper-right corner option menu to kick off data fetching.
2. Show shimmer-effect loading place holder while wating on data.
3. View items enter with Animation.
4. Fetched data also saved in SQLite database for off-line reading.
